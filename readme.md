Lamar Event Tracker is a location based application. This app is most useful for students, professors, and parents who are new to the Lamar University. It shows all the upcoming calendar events that are going to happen in the university. Existing students or faculty can also utilize this app to keep updated with the list of events.

If a user wants to attend a particular event and he is not aware of the exact location where the event is going to happen, he can use this app to select that particular event and with a click of a button, the app will show the shortest path from the user's location to the event location.
